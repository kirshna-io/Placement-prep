1. X can do a piece of work in 40 days. He works at it for 8 days and then Y finished it in 16 days. How long will they together take to complete the work?  
         13 1/3 days
         15 days
         20 days
         26 days

      Solution :
          X's one day work = 1/40
          work done in 8 days = 1/40 * 8 = 1/5
          Remaining work = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5  
          Remaining work completed by Y in 16 = 5/4 * 16 = 20

          1/40 + 1/20 = 3/40 = 13 1/3 
     Answer : 13 1/3 days

2.  A and B together can do a piece of work in 30 days. A having worked for 16 days, B finishes the remaining work alone in 44 days. 
    In how many days shall B finish the whole work alone?
    30 days
    40 days
    60 days
    70 days

        Solution :
              A's one dayd work = 1/16  
              B's one dayd work = 1/44

              x+y = 1
              16x+44y = 1/30
              Solving these equations y=1/60

      Answer : 60 days
