1.Amruta can do a piece of work in 20 days.Narendra is 25% more efficient than Amruta.  The number of days taken by Narendra to do the same piece of work in?
Option:
a, 15 days
b, 16 days
c, 18 days
d, 20 days
Solution: 

25% eff 
100 + 25 = 125
125:100 =  5:4
we take for n day 
     5:4 = 20:n
     5*n = 20*4
     n = (20*4)/5
     n = 16 days


correct answer is option B     

2.A can finish a work in 24 dyas B in 9 days and C in 12 days.   B and c start the work but are forced to leave after 3 days. The remaining work was done by A is?
Option:
a, 5 days
b, 6 days
c, 10 days
d, 11 days
Solution:
LCM of 24,9,12 is 216
Therefore, efficiency of A is 216/24=9
           efficiency of A is 216/9=24
           efficiency of A is 216/12=18
B and C start the work so efficiency of B+C is 24+18=42 for 3 days 3*42=126
so B and C completed the work together is 126. Then the remaining work is 216-126=90
A takes to complete the work is remaining work/efficiency of A=90/9=10 days

correct answer is option c
