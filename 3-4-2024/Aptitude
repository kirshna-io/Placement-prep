1. 4 men and 6 women can complete the work in 8 days. While 3 men and 7 women can complete the work in 10 days. In how many days 10 women will complete the work?
       A.40 days
       B.42 days
       C.30 days
       D.36 days

      Solution :
            4m+6w=1/8 .....(1)
            3m+7w=1/10 ....(2)
            Multiply equation(1) by 3 and equation(2) by 4
            12m+18w=3/8
            12m+28w=4/10
            Subtract the two equations,
            10 w = 4/10 âˆ’ 3/10
                = 1/40

        Answer : 40 days



2. If 10 carpenters working 4 hours a day can make 320 chairs in 200 days, then number of chairs made by 16 carpenters in 32 days each working 6 hours in a day
       A.120
       B.122
       C.123
       D.124

          Solution :
                N1 = 10, T1 = 4, D1 = 200, C1 = 320
                N1 = 16, T1 = 6, D1 = 32, C1 = ?

                10*4*200/320 = 16*6*32/C1
                C1 = 16*6*32*320/10*4*200
                C1 = 123
          Answe : 123
